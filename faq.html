           <dt>Q: Can I throw and catch a chakram like a frisbee?</dt>
           <dd>A: No. Unlike a frisbee, you cannot grab a chakram in the air as the outer edge is extremely sharpened.</dd>

          <dl>
            <dt>Q: Is it possible to carry multiple chakrams at once?</dt>
            <dd>A: Yes. Chakram users had often worn several chakrams, in the maximum eight, since a chakram weighs only 150-500 grams per each, and it is possible to wear them around their necks or on their turbans.</dd>
